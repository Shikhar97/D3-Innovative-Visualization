# NASA Exoplanets Visualization

## Overview

This project aims to provide an interactive visualization of the NASA Exoplanets dataset using radar charts and bubble charts. The dataset contains a comprehensive catalog of exoplanets discovered by NASA missions. The visualization is implemented using D3.js, a powerful JavaScript library for creating data-driven web applications.

## Features

- **Radar Chart**: Explore the characteristics of exoplanets through a radar chart, allowing users to compare multiple features simultaneously.
- **Bubble Chart**: Visualize the distribution of exoplanets based on different parameters using a bubble chart, providing insights into the dataset.


## Getting Started

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone 
    
    ```

2. **Run the development server:**
    ```python3 -m http.server 8080
    ```

    This will start a local development server, and you can access the visualization at `http://localhost:8080` in your web browser.

## Data Source
